# BoidAlgaeTerminator
Using Unity3D.
We release a swarm of simulated bots in a volume which is populated with virtual algae.
Each robot in the swarm has a organic content detector to find algae.
They will also have a chemical container (chlorine) for topical deployment.
Bots will also be armed with UV lasers to destroy smaller clusters of algae.
The objective is to purify a water body in minimum time and chemical usage.
